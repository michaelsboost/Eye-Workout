My Eye Workout was the very first free and open source eye fitness application ever released. It was inspired by [Eye Workout](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eye-workout/id763029932) (iOS app), [Toby Tarsierâ€™s Eye Fitness Workout](http://www.janessig.com/new-app-toby-tarsiers-eye-fitness-workout/) (commercial mac app) and [Eye Care Plus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyeexamtest.eyecareplus&hl=en_US) (Android app).
